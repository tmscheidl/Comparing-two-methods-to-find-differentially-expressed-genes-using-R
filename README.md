# Comparing-two-methods-to-find-differentially-expressed-genes-using-R

The goal for the assignment is to compare the list of differentially expressed genes from two methods of gene selection (limma and t-test), using the same set of CEL files.
We are working on microarray samples that had been made in the context of a skin cancer project. There are two groups, on control group (labeled “C”) and a second one where some medication has been tested (“D”).
